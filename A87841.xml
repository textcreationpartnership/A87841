            <title>An epitome or briefe discoverie, from the beginning to the ending, of the many and great troubles that Dr. Leighton suffered in his body, estate, and family, for the space of twelve years and upwards. Wherein is laid down the cause of those sufferings; namely that book called Sions plea against the prelacie, together with the warrantable call that he had to the work: and also, the hard and heavie passage of the prelates proceedings against him, in the high Commission, and Star-Chamber. And lastly, their invective speeches in the said Court of Star-Chamber; from the impeachment whereof, and the accusations charged upon him, he vindicates himself by a just defence.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Laſtly, I conceived I ſhould have more fiſts about mine eares then mine owne, if that worke came to light; but notwithſtanding of all theſe feares and doubts, their importunity and my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, (though in much weakeneſſe) to bring any thing to the Publique Cauſe, prevailed with me, and I framed up the proofes, which being peruſed, gave full ſatisfaction: they deſired me to goe beyond the Seas, and publiſh it; which I told them, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could, nor would doe, without the review, and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Godlieſt, Learnedſt, and moſt judicious of the Land, both Miniſters, and others: by ſuch parties the thing being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, ſome whereof were Parliament-men, I deſired their hands to it, which they freely granted, yea (as I confeſſed in my Examination to the Atturney Generall) I had 500. hands to it. Away I went, and publiſhed it beyond Seas, being both a chargeable and painfull peece; and becauſe ſome might think that I might ayme at gaine, if any did ſo, they might anſwer themſelves, the fiery heate of the Worke would burne up the gaines; but to anſwer more directly, I profeſſe I had in all but 50 pound of ſome private friends for the defraying of all char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which was but a poore pittance of that which it coſt me; beſides, mine owne charges, the thing it ſelfe coſt me triple, to haſten it to the Parliament, beſides the intermiſſion of my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And being done, the Parliament had two of them ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by a friend; but the Parliament being diſſolved, I ſhut up ſhop till a better time; but fearing to come over (for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had his Spies there) I gave order to my wife to put away my houſe, and houſe-hold-ſtuffe, which was done to our great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113796:5"/>detriment: but in <hi>July</hi> following I came over, we ſet up houſe againe, which being ſcarſe fully furniſhed; and wherein I had not been above ſix weekes, when on the 17. of <hi>February</hi> 1629. comming out of <hi>Blacke-friers</hi> Church, <hi>Croſſe</hi> and <hi>Tomlins</hi> two High Commiſſion Purſevants, with many others with them, by an High Commiſſion Warrant, attached mee, and dragged me with great force and violence to <hi>London-houſe,</hi> where I remained untill 7. of the Clocke. When the Prelate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Fulham</hi> with Doctor <hi>Corbet</hi> in his Coach; <hi>Croſſe</hi> made a ſhew to bring me before the Prelate, but he meant it not, for they carryed me through a <hi>ſubterranean-way,</hi> opening up a doore (as they ſaid) not opened ſince Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> daies, and having brought bolts to put upon me, they carried me with an huge multitude of Bills, and Staves, to <hi>Newgate;</hi> in the entry whereof they had almoſt kill'd my Wife: and there they caſt me into <hi>A naſty Dog-hole,</hi> full of <hi>Rats,</hi> and <hi>Miee,</hi> no light almoſt but from the uncovered Roofe, no place but the ruines of an old chimney for fire, affoording me neither meat, drinke, nor bedding; ſo that I had been betweene the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at night, and the Thurſday at noone, without food. Two doores were ſhut upon me, and none ſuffered to come at mee. The ſumme of all this is in my Petition to the High Court of Parliament, and alſo in my Anſwer to the Star-chamber Bill.</p>

               <p>THe third day of my Impriſonment, the keepers called mee out of the pit, where I was humbling my ſoule before God, and brought me to an upper Chamber, where ſeven or eight of the High Commiſſion, with the Clerke of the Regiſter, were ſet at a Table. After an interview, and ſome pauſe taken; Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> began to regrete my condition, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more of my parts, then I was capable off; withall hee told me, that they were come to examine mee. I anſwered, that it ſeemed unreaſonable to me, to indanger a mans life by ſo <hi>cloſe,</hi> and <hi>hard Impriſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>t,</hi> and then to examine: but I deſiring to know their authority, and whether they were not of the High Commiſſion? they anſwered, yea; I replyed, that I could not, and therefore would not be examined by them; and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe by an unlawfull warrant, they had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113796:6"/>violently caſt mee into a lothſome Priſon. Secondly, both the Lawes of God and the King, doe forbid them to meddle with the <hi>body</hi> or <hi>goods</hi> of the <hi>Subject;</hi> whereupon the Commiſſion under Seale being produced, and laid upon the Table, Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> told me, that himſelfe and Doctor <hi>Reeve</hi> had order from the King, to take mine Examination. I replyed, that it was more then I knew: but howſoever, if they would lay aſide their Commiſſion, and by vertue of the Kings command exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me: I would anſwer them. Not ſo, ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Martin;</hi> then ſaid I, not ſo neither as you would, will I be examined. You will not, ſaid he, be examined by any, but by the King. That is your Aſſertion, ſay I, and not mine, neither have you any ground for it: for if it pleaſe his Majeſtie to ſend his meaneſt Foot-man with a lawfull Warrant, I will obey without more adoe. They brought out two Bookes, demanding of me if they were of my doing; I replyed, that neither directly, nor indirectly I would anſwer one word, <hi>ut ſub judice.</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> asked me then, ſince I would not be examined, if I would ſpend ſome time in diſcourſe with them; I anſwered, with all my heart; ſo they would not lye at advantage to enſnare me. Sir <hi>Henry Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> ſaid, that they would not: I told them that the world knew that the <hi>Looking-glaſſe of the Holy Warre,</hi> was mine; and I had ſuffered much from them, unjuſtly for it: and as for the other Booke, I would acquit my ſelfe in that, as a lawfull examiner ſhould occaſion me. The Clerke offered to write thoſe paſſages; but I told him, he ſhould not, for it was contrary to covenant; ſo Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> cauſed him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare; and laying by all their tooles, we fell to other matter. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> asked me what I thought of the <hi>Kings Supremacie.</hi> I replyed, that if I ſhould bee put <hi>Legally</hi> to it; my anſwer ſhould give <hi>Caeſar that which was Caeſars.</hi> I told him further, that being a Schollar, and a great <hi>Civillian,</hi> he could not chuſe but know; what both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> (<hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>) had delivered concerning that: hee replied, it was true: neither was he ſo groſſe, as to thinke any King or other Man to be Head of the Church; onely he did hold the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>Soveraigne</hi> and <hi>Supreame Governour under Christ.</hi> Then (ſaid I) Sir <hi>Henry</hi> you have anſwered your ſelfe; but of this further in mine Examination by Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> then <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney Generall.</hi> From that he fell to aske me, what was the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113796:6"/>reaſon that I did oppoſe the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> ſo vehemently. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, true it is, I have ever oppoſed them, ſince the Lord called me; but I proteſted, and that truely, it was not out of hatred to their perſons, though I and mine had ſuffered by them: nor out of envie to their places, whence their wealth, honour, and caſe might acrue: but firſt, becauſe their <hi>Places and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are not of God.</hi> Secondly, becauſe in executing of their <hi>Places,</hi> they take more upon them, then either the <hi>Law of God, or Man, alloweth them:</hi> to the prejudice and abuſing of the Kings graunts, the heavie detriment of the Subject, and the highly indangering of themſelves: and this I offered to make good: and as for their perſons, I told them, I wiſhed them as well as my ſelfe. What? ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> if it bee ſo, we are all miſtaken; doe you not thinke that they are of God; Nothing leſſe (ſaid I) neither thinke I that they thinke themſelves ſo, if they will impartially examine their owne hearts: for they know thoſe thoughts to bee contrary to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the current of <hi>Humane Writers,</hi> and to their owne <hi>Peremptory Aſſertions</hi> in their owne Workes, written by them for their defence. Yea, ſaid Sir <hi>Henrie Martin,</hi> but I will prove it thus, is there not ſuperioritie in a <hi>Civill ſtate;</hi> and was there not ſuperiority in the <hi>State Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> under the Jewes: Witneſſe <hi>Aaron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ergo, Biſhops</hi> by Divine Right ſhould be over <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all my preſſures, I ſmiled to heare their Champion for the time; beat the braines out of their cauſe, with a beame of their owne making, or of the Popes; withall I told Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> that his <hi>Anticedent</hi> and <hi>Conſequent</hi> were of ſo deepe diſtance, that all the Learning in the World, could never make them meet. Yet he ſet a face to prove it, by a connex Propoſition;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>If Aaron were over the Prieſts,</l>
                  <l>Then Biſhops ſhould be over Miniſters, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I denyed the Connexion, and told him that all the learning amongſt them could not advance that Argument one foot; nor no more they did; but being at a ſtand, I told Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> that he could not of all the Quiver, have choſen a deadlier ſhaft againſt themſelves; as ſhould appeare by the retorting of the Argument thus.</p>

The premiſes being thus invincibly proved, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> for a while was ſilent; but at laſt brake out to his Fellow-Commiſſioners in this ſort; <hi>Gentlemen, I can goe no further, and I aſſure you if it be thus, you may burne all your Bookes.</hi> The three <hi>Deanes,</hi> or <hi>Parſons,</hi> or what they were with the Doctor, ſate ſtill mute as Fiſh, not anſwering one word. By Gods mercy, truth thus prevailing; Sir <hi>Henry</hi> began to touch on an old Callumnie, Doctor (ſaith

               <p>Hereof it ſhall not be amiſſe (according to my ſimple know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to ſay ſomething for the clearing of Gods people, and good duties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, againſt Gods people, for the performance of ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there is no Law, Statute, or Command;<note place="margin">Sect.</note> and where there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, it is both contumely, and injury, againſt God and the duties; and a wreſting of the Law againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> to urge it againſt the ſaid performances: ſince it is againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Law, and the intent of the Law-giver, witneſſe both the Commiſſion of <hi>Peace,</hi> giving power to inquire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,</hi> which are ſaid to be <hi>againſt the Peace:</hi> and alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Statutes made againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> containing the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of offendors therein; as 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Mar. cap.</hi> 12. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Eliza. cap.</hi> 17. theſe are called <hi>

               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Matter of Conventicles,</hi> doth cleare thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the Name;<note place="margin">Sect. Lambert.</note> for the ſubject-matter of every <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> muſt (as the learned in the Law obſerve) be, <hi>an unlawful act done, or intended;</hi> but no law with us ſaith ſo of <hi>Faſting, and praying;</hi> and more particularly, in every <hi>Conventicle,</hi> there is a manifeſt <hi>diſturbance of the peace, in a greater or leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: as threatning ſpeach, turbulent geſture, ſhew of Armes, or expreſſion of Violence:</hi> but by the contrary, <hi>Faſting and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113796:8"/>Praying are the maine preſervers of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the end of a <hi>Conventicle</hi> is ever, or for the moſt part, <hi>evill;</hi> as to <hi>diſturbe the Peace, or revenge ſome Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore it is ſaid to be <hi>in terrorem populi,</hi> which words, are alwaies laid as mainely materiall, in an Indictment of this nature: but the intent of ſuch as humble their ſoules, is to <hi>meet God by Repentance,</hi> that he may <hi>meet us in Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and therefore no <hi>Conventicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Manner of a Conventicle,</hi> which gives the being to the thing is naught, as <hi>Diſorderly,, Tumultuouſly,</hi> or <hi>Extreamly ſuſpitiouſly,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Places, Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Perſons;</hi> being dangerous to true <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>State.</hi> But they that humble themſelves, are no <hi>Suſpitious perſons,</hi> nor make they any diſorder, or <hi>tumult</hi> in comming together; but ſoberly, and holily, taking due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with them; they doe behave themſelves for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and ſay there were ſome <hi>Anomalie,</hi> in the carriage of the buſineſſe, yet it is farre from ſuch an inormitie, as maketh up a <hi>Conventicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, they differ in the <hi>Effects;</hi> the effects of a <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> at the beſt, are the diſquieting and terrifying of the more peaceable ſort by their Act; and the imboldning of ſuch buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies as live upon confuſion by their evill example; beſides the blood-ſhed and other wrong that often falls out. But the <hi>Mourners in Sion</hi> are not onely meanes to keepe the peace; and to prevent the violence of feares, but alſo to pacifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable; either bringing Lyons to be Lambs; or at leaſt by power of Prayer reſtraining their rage; ſo that there is nothing of a <hi>Conventicle</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, they are altogether different in their <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> for the Devill and mans corruption are the cauſes of a <hi>Conventicle;</hi> But of afflicting the ſoule by humiliation, God is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Mover.</hi> By all theſe large differences, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth what wrong they doe unto <hi>God,</hi> to his <hi>People,</hi> to his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the <hi>State;</hi> Who call the gathering together of <hi>Gods people, a Conventicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For further clearing; to theſe I may adde ſome experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall trials in our times. A certaine Judge, <hi>cujus nomini parco,</hi> (but no Friend to <hi>Sion;</hi>) was complained unto in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, by a <hi>Prophane exorbitant Crew,</hi> that certaine godly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113796:8"/>people in the place where they lived did keep Conventicles; the ground of which complaint, was their miſchievous malice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt that people, becauſe ſome of them being in office, had laid the Law to their <hi>Propheneſſe,</hi> the judge gave order to theſe <hi>evill men,</hi> to indict the other for Conventicle-keeping; his Brother Judge <hi>Itinerant</hi> being in the Room and over hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, asked him what thoſe men were about, which he deſiring to conceale, he told him plainly that he knew the matter, and told alſo the people, that the courſe they were about was very illegall and injurious, and if they could not prove the people Conventicle-keepers (which they could not indeed) they would have a good action againſt them, whereupon they deſiſted.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance from a Gentlemans caſe in the North, who was accuſed by a Purſeivant for keeping of Conventicles, he took witneſſe of ſuch as were preſent, and ſued the Purſevant at <hi>York,</hi> where the caſe was cleared on the Gentlemans ſide, beſides ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pound given him for damnages: As this hitteth home (as I have ſhewed) the enemies of God; ſo it miſſeth not that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick feare which is in ſome of Gods people, <hi>qui trepidatione mentis &amp; brevificto de minis;</hi> Who out of the trembling of the minde, and through a fained briefe of threatnings, would once call in queſtion their divine tenor of humiliation, or gathering themſelves (as the Scripture phraſeth) in more Families, againſt which there is not one jot of <hi>Lawes Statute</hi> or <hi>Common;</hi> and for <hi>Divine warrant</hi> (which no humane Law can contradict) I will ſay no more at this time but this, becauſe I have largely handled it other where, it is ſtrictly and frequently commanded, and highly commended by God the Law-giver; all bleſſings promiſed to the performance of it, all judgements threatned againſt the neglect of it, yea the heavieſt in all the Book of God, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 22.14. and accordingly promiſes and threatnings have been accompliſhed; thus having borrowed leave by way of digreſſion, to clear ſo good and excellent a duty, of ſo foul and undeſerved a name; I returne unto the cloſure of our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, where by the way I doe not approve of erroneous and phanatick with-drawing from the publique Ordinance.</p>
               <p>O ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Martin,</hi> I doe not meane a Conventicle, but I meane <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Praying;</hi> ſure (ſaid I) there is as great difference between theſe, as between <hi>loyaltie to God and man,</hi> and <hi>ranke diſobedience</hi> to both: But if Faſting and Praying

               <p>A While after came Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> Atturney Generall to examine me, who told me that the King was informed that I would not be examined; I anſwered I had the more wrong, and that the contrary might appeare: I was willing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined not only by him, but by the meaneſt of his Majeſties Subjects that ſhould come with lawfull Authority. It was true, I refuſed to be examined by the High Commiſſioners delivering my Reaſons in effect, which formerly I have ſet down: In
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113796:9"/>which Reaſons he ſeemed to acquieſce, proceeding to examine me concerning a book eſpecially; three ſeverall Examinations of me they have <hi>verbatim,</hi> the more materiall things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will but touch. To his firſt <hi>Quere</hi> concerning the Book I told him <hi>ſalvo meliori judicio,</hi> that I had rather cauſe to enquire why I had ſuffered ſo much, and ſo long, without any cauſe knowne, then firſt to put ſuch heavy things upon me, and then to examine the cauſe; for I knew nothing by my ſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they, for any thing I knew, any juſt matter of ſuch uſage againſt me. As for the Book I told him, if any man could charge either with Book or any other thing; wherein I had tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed I was willing to ſatisfie the Law: In the meane time, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as one yet cleer in Law, to goe upon ſufficient Baile, and ſo to come to my Anſwer: he confeſſed the Anſwer was reaſonable, but in that he told me the King was very deſirous to know the Author, and that not for any evill to him; and if I would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what I knew, it would be acceptable to the King; (or in his very words) the King would take it well: yea if it intrenched upon my ſelfe, I ſhould finde as much favour as I could wiſh. To which I anſwered, if it were a thing ſo pleaſing unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and if he would be pleaſed to lay a particular command upon me, I would diſcover what I knew by my ſelfe in that; yea, if I knew guilt by my ſelfe, which indeed I did not. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well content with this, and in words regreeting my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, he went away and withall making offer, &amp;c. And the next time returned with the Kings particular command (as he ſaid) for in my ſecond Examination it was thus ſet downe: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Kings Majeſties particular command,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelfe to be the whole and ſole Author and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Book,</hi> &amp;c. For this in effect was the ſumme of my ſecond confeſſion concerning my Book. As we were upon diſcourſe, he told me that it was given out that I ſhould deny the Kings <hi>ſupremacy;</hi> I anſwered, that it was an unjuſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for I was never put to it <hi>juridice,</hi> ſo I told him in effect ſome paſsages between Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> and my ſelf by way of diſcourſe; and how his anſwer was in effect my tenet, and I deſired in my heart in regard of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> not to come ſhort of any ſubject: Well ſaid he, you ſhall doe well alſo to expreſſe your ſelfe by me in that particular, that if any ſuch aſperſion be laid upon you, by giving the King ſatisfaction it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113796:10"/>I told him I was very willing and deſired him to write my expreſſions, which I delivered in theſe words or to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>I acknowledge</hi> (ex animo) <hi>as much dominion and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to belong unto our King over all his dominions, and therein over all his Subjects and cauſes, as any of the Kings of Judah or Iſrael had over their dominions, and the premiſes therein; ſave onely in thoſe things wherein they were Types of Chriſt, or had a particular warrant.</hi> This he told me at his returne, he had ſhewed to the King, and that it gave him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good content, (for it is all he could deſire) but he ſaid he had not heard that caſe ſo well cleared, but for all this I had no releaſe, neither favour afforded, for being, or well-being, only my Wife permitted to come to me.</p>
               <p>The third approach of Mr. Atturney was <hi>nerve tranſverſo</hi> with a croſſe ſinew, namely, to examine me who were my <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>abettors</hi> in the worke, for they conceived I had not done it without the helping hand, of the moſt <hi>judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> in the Land. To this demand I replyed, that it was beſides my Covenant, yet being willing to ſatisfie all demands ſo far as I could without prejudice to others, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed (as I have alſo anſwered to the information) <hi>that no living ſoule had any hand in compoſing Page or Line of that Book ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my ſelfe:</hi> For I told him as I was not ſo ambitious, as to derogate from other men if any thing in it were praiſe-worthy; ſo I was not ſo Prodigall of my ſelfe as to ſuffer by taking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens workes upon my ſelfe: Then he asked me whether I was moved to it by ſome other, or if it came of my ſelfe, I told him I was moved by ſome well-affected people to frame a draught of their deſires to the Parliament then being, which all the Kings leige people might doe, but they differing for a time upon the Subject matter; at length it was concluded to deſire the removall of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and their <hi>Appendices,</hi> as the maine root of all our bitterneſſe; and the eſtabliſhing of Chriſts Ordinances in their power and beauty; together with the grounds of theſe our deſires; for reaſon doth convince, and experience teacheth that <hi>toto ſublato non officiunt partes,</hi> take away the whole, and the parts will doe no hurt. And where diverſe Petitions had been put up for Reformation of divers parts, with little or no ſucceſſe, it were as good without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, (by ſhewing the extent of their deſires) to heave at all; as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113796:10"/>the Proverbe is, <hi>cum pulviſculo;</hi> yea the Scripture teacheth us, the beſt way to ſweeten waters is to begin at the fountaines<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whereupon I framed thoſe <hi>Ten Poſitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſet downe in the Booke, the proofes whereof being exceedingly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I drew a ſcantling of them; which being by ſerious view peruſed, it had the approbation and hands of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good people; ſo that I may ſafely ſay, I ran not unſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſſe. The Atturney urged me to give up the names of thoſe Approvers, with many faire promiſes of liberty, and what not: I anſwered, that in my judgement there was neither Law nor Conſcience for it. For what had the people done, but that which good ſubjects might ſafely doe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though there was no danger in the Act, yet the re-vailing of them might endanger them, which I would be loth to doe. Thirdly, as it was done in time of Parliament, when every ſubject might without impeachment unfold a <hi>publique grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> ſo if that high Court were in being, and ſhould call them to it, they ſhould either avouch the act; or I would deliver both their names and hands. He replyed, that though I was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vers'd in the Law, yet it was not my faculty. I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red true, yet I ſtood in need of ſo much as to ſquare my wayes by, and if he being a great Lawyer, could give me any ground for that he required from the Law of God or Man, I would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him forthwith, and every man ſhould beare his owne burthen. To this I received no anſwer, but after a pauſe, hee told me that the King would take it ill; for the deniall of ſuch a thing, was an Argument that I loved him not, I reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that I would not for a Kingdome give him juſt cauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but obedience muſt be ruled; and for my love to his Majeſty let my actions and ſufferings witneſſe to the would; for if I had not loved my Soveraign better then my life, I had not put my life in my hand, in the diſcovery of truths ſo ſtrongly oppoſed; which if they ſhould not prevaile; I might partly conceive what it would coſt me, witneſſe the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my hard uſage: In concluſion he began to bee rough, and to threaten me with the Rod: To which I anſwered, the <hi>rod was in Gods hand, and he ſhould doe well to looke to it; for the wrath of man did not accompliſh the righteouſneſſe of God;</hi> and for his threatnings, I hoped they ſhould never bring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113796:11"/>me to be an accuſer of the <hi>Brethren.</hi> Thus much in effect paſſed between the Atturney Generall and me, where though not <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> yet I have not wronged him one jot, but how much in this matter he wronged both me and himſelfe, Lord open his eyes to ſee it.</p>

               <p>AT length after fifteen weeks hard Impriſonment, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell uſage in that loathſome priſon, I was ſerved with a <hi>Sub-poena</hi> out of the Star-chamber, whether I was appointed to goe to take out the Information againſt me; having for the moſt part one Theefe or other out of <hi>Newgate</hi> to be my Keeper; ſo that I durſt hardly come in any houſe for feare of his lime-twig fingers,</p>

The laſt Interrogatory was, <hi>Who were privy to the compoſing of the Book.</hi> I anſwered the Examiner (as formerly the Atturney) that I was not tyed to anſwer that Interrogatory by any Law; yea the <hi>Law did exempt me,</hi> inſtance 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. Whereas it is held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt equity and order of juſtice, to call any man in <hi>danger of Life, Name, or State,</hi> upon intrapping Interrogatories, or by any other Meanes then <hi>Witneſſe, Verdict, Confeſſion,</hi> or <hi>Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> ſo it is illegall to delate a brother accuſed of the ſame thing eſpecially, not evil in it ſelfe but taken to be evill.

If any happily reply, that it was the Kings mercy to alter the caſe, and that I ſhould ſuffer in this ſort, in ſtead of puniſhment due to Treaſon. To which I anſwer, as I did in publique preſence, that if I might have but a due Tryall at Common-Law, and if I periſhed that way, I would think it in favour howſoever. So in this caſe, I may ſay with <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Beneficiam in vito non datur.</note> A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Benefit is no Benefit, when a man may not chuſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in two Evils it is a poor Benefit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I am perſwaded, that herein his Majeſty is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; For how can they change the Guilt and Puniſhment, before the Guilt be known; and how can it be known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law try it? And further, where the favours of Kings are free, and Accumalative. But this kind of Commutation is into a Puniſhment more bitter then death, and for ſhame and ignominy: what more can be? If it were not the glory of the Lord that reſteth upon the Cauſe, and ſo turnes the ſhame of the ſuffering into glory.</p>

               <p>Firſt, was there any unjuſt cauſe undertaken, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by me? or any that moved me to the work? was there <hi>concurſus ad vivum,</hi> any violent manning out of the matter? was there any Conſpiracy, any Conjutation? was the ruine of the tottering State, or rather the recovery ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at by us?

               <p>Laſtly, in matter and manner of our recourſe, nothing laid down but the very open and publike Diſeaſes of the Church and State. Proved invincibly from the Laws of God and Man; pleading for nothing more next unto Chriſts right, then the right of the King.</p>
               <p>For the truth of all which and true intent in handling of it, I call my Conſcience to record and God himſelf, which is greater then Conſcience; For which truth I alſo ſuffer, and am ready by Gods aſſiſtance to ſuffer to the laſt, if he think it good.

The former is either good abſolutely of it ſelf, or accidentally in regard of the Sequel. The former of theſe is determined by the Object; namely, for that which is good, by the Perſon, in regard of generall or particular Call: Conſidering alſo Time and Place; and this is not only permitted as lawfull, but alſo enjoyned, and commanded. The Apoſtle St. Jude held it needfull to write to all the Churches with all diligence, and to exhort them to contend earneſtly for the Faith,<note n="*" place="margin">Jude 3</note> where every word hath its own weight. Firſt, for the object, Faith, is meant <hi>fides qua,</hi> the grace of Faith, whereby we are juſtified, and the word of Faith, whereby we are brought to believe, and made perfect unto every good work.</p>
               <p>For this. and for all other pure Ordinances of Chriſt, Chriſtians muſt contend, which is the Action here enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Where the compound <gap reason="foreign">

And this muſt be followed againſt Sathan the World, the Fleſh: Sathans Inſtruments; as Tyrants, Heretikes, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, Hypocrites, in a word, againſt all the Enemies of Chriſt, and of his Truth.

               <p>In the ſecond place, he gives expreſſe charge to contend for the maintenance of thoſe Colours, by ſtanding to it. Stand faſt (ſaith he) &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Another kind of Contention, though not good in it ſelf, yet accidentally proveth often good to the Church and State, namely, by the contention of the wieked amongſt themſelves; when God ſetteth the Tsanſgreſſor againſt the Tranſgreſſor he thereby purifieth the Ayre, and giveth his own a breathing time.

               <p>He might be a pretry States-man of 12 or 14 yeares of Age: But to the point, he ſaid, he had never heard, nor ſeen all that time ſuch a vile Book, preferring it to <hi>Baalams Aſſe, Martin Mar-Prelate, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dals</hi> Book, and all the reſt; and wondered, that ſuch a Traytor, as I, was ſuffered to live And for his Calling, he proteſted he had it from the Holy Ghoſt, and if he could not make it good, he would fling his <hi>Rochet</hi> and all the reſt from his back, yea that would he.

After he had given me many blowes and vented his choller, he came into a better
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:113796:42"/>mood; namely; of <hi>praying for me,</hi> that if I were not as <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> he prayed God to forgive me; with that a Lawyer not able to forbear laughing asked another that ſtood by, if ever he heard before, that it was a ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt to write againſt the <hi>B B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the firſt; namely, Prejudgment which makes the Judgment rather wrath, then judgment, the indignation wherewith the Prelates were filled, doth prove it ful<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that made the proceeding unformall. in mouthing of which, <hi>I. R.</hi> firſt ran foule, whom the Prelats followed; ſo that the houſe did reſound <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The third Deformity in proceeding is to <hi>wreſt words,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond either the Letter, or intent of the Speaker, or Writer. This (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) is to take things in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer part, and not to find a party guilty by the Law, and ſo to cenſure him; but to put, or inforce guilt upon him that they may cenſure him.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt point, but not the leaſt, wherein the forme of proceeding failed, was the <hi>condemning</hi> and <hi>cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of me <hi>without hearing;</hi> a courſe indeed againſt <hi>Nature,</hi> againſt all <hi>Lawes Divine,</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> Civill, Common and Canon-Laws, <hi>againſt the Law of Nations, againſt the practice of God himſelf</hi> as <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed, <hi>againſt the practice of Chriſt, and the priviledge of all men.</hi>

Yea, I may confidently affirme, that Judges condemning a Delinquent without hearing, doe often become the greater Delinquents, both in regard of the Perſon and of the Act: The more conſpicuous the perſon is the greater is the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; and a corrupt Act in Juſtice is farre worſe then an exemplary evill in the Judges life. Becauſe the former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the Publique Founrain; the other but a Draw-well in a mans own ground. If it be further objected, that my anſwer was read in the Court. To this I reply, that was beſides my intention, becauſe it was but an abridgment of that which I could and would have ſaid in defence of my

Secondly, though the Anſwer being preſented to the then Lord Keeper, was acknowledged by him to be as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as ever any Anſwer that was put into the Starre-Chamber. Yet all reaſon required, that I ſhould have had perſonall audience: Firſt, that I might anſwer to that which might be further objected: and further, ſince they gave me order for putting in my own Anſwer, becauſe Councell durſt not plead, and the Law did allot me twice as much time for my Defence, as the At<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But when all this would not ſerve to cut the threed of my weariſome life, a <hi>maſter-piece</hi> of <hi>cruelty</hi> was deviſed and followed by four parties, whoſe names are known; namely, to caſt me into the common Jayle, for the effecting whereof, they ſet eight ſtrong fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes upon me, who with violence bruiſed my body, and did through me into a loathſome lowſie place, forty ſeven dark ſteps up, amongſt ſome ſixteen or more of wicked and debaſed ones, for the moſt part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the earth had not: the fall of the houſe endangered my life. I lay ten weekes under the Canopy of Heaven, in the dirt and mire of the rubbiſh, having nothing to ſhelter me from the Rain and Snow in a very cold Seaſon. I had many aſſaults made upon me to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113796:47"/>take away my life, yea even then, when I lay very weake under the hand of God; All thoſe paſſages, and many more, concerning the company, place, and cruell uſage, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſufficiently to the honourable Committee: And for the further evidence, Warden <hi>Ingram</hi> told the Counſell (as hee ſaid that it was not a place to put any man in, that was fit to converſe with an honeſt man. A Member of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable houſe laying my deplorable caſe much to heart (as they all did) ſaid that he had rather have ſuffered all my former inflictions, and have loſt his right hand too, (which he would not for a Kingdome) than have undergone thoſe <hi>Common-Iayle ſufferings,</hi> which were a ſn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have a Treatiſe by it ſelf of this inhumane practiſe to be publiſhed; the reading whereof, I am perſwaded will make the Bowels to earne. At length, in great weakneſſe, with much adoe, under Ten thouſand pound Bay, I recovered my <hi>Priſon-pallace</hi> (I may ſay) having been there a while, and gotten ſome recovery, it pleaſed the Lord, to move his Majeſty, to call this preſent Parliament, who was graciouſly pleaſed to call for my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as the firſt work; which when I came abroad to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I could neither <hi>goe, hear,</hi> nor <hi>ſee,</hi> though my Petition was larger, then I thought the Houſe would admit: yet out of <hi>ſence</hi> of my <hi>diſtreſſe,</hi> it was <hi>twice read,</hi> and my cauſe much regrated with tears of compaſſion: the Petition it ſelf, I have here inſerted.</p>

                     <p>HOw your much and long diſtreſſed Petitioner on the 17 of <hi>February</hi> gone ten yeares, was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Black-Friers, coming from the Sermon, by a high Commiſſion Warrant (to which no Subjects body is lyable) and thence with a multitude of ſtaffes and Bills, was dragged along (and all the way reproached by the name of Jeſuit and Traytor) till they brought him to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> houſe, where he was ſhut up, and by a ſtrong guard kept (without food) till ſeven of the clock at night, till Dr. <hi>Lawd</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:113796:48"/>then Prelate of <hi>London,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> then of <hi>Oxford,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in Coach from <hi>Pullam</hi> houſe, with a Troop atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The Gaoler of Newgate was ſent for, who came with Irous, and with a ſtrong power of Halberts and Staves they carryed your Petitioner through a blind hollow way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretence or examination, and opening up a Gate into the ſtreet (which ſome ſay, had not been opened ſince Q. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes) they thruſt him into a loathſome and ruinous dog-hole, full of Rats and Mice, which had no light, but a little grate; and the Roofe being uncovered, the Snow and Rain beat in upon him, having no Bedding, nor place to make fire, but the ruines of an old ſmoaky Chimney, where he had neither meat nor drink, from the Tueſday at night, till the Thurſday at Noon. In this wofull place and doleful plight, they kept him cloſe, with two doors ſhut upon him, for the ſpace of fifteen weekes, ſuffering none to come at him, till at length, his wife was only admitted.</p>
                     <p>The fourth day after his commitment, the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Purſevants came (under the conduct of the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi>) to your Petitioners houſe, and a mighty multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with them, giving out, that they came to ſearch for Jeſuites Bookes. There thoſe violent Fellowes of prey, laid violent hands upon your Petitioners diſtreſſed wife, with ſuch barbarous inhumanity, as he is aſhamed to expreſſe, and ſo rifled every ſoule in the houſe, holding a bent Piſtoll to a childs breaſt of five years old, threatning to kill him, if he would not tell where the bookes were, through which, the child was ſo affrighted that he never caſt it. They broke up Preſſes, Cheſts, Boxes, the Boards of the Houſe, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they found in the way, though they were willing to open all. They and ſome of the Sheriffs men ſpoyled, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and carryed away all the Books and Manuſcripts they found, with Houſhold-ſtuffe, your Petitioners Apparell, Armes, and other things; ſo that they left nothing that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them: notwithſtanding, your Petitioners wife told the Sheriffs, they might come to reckon for it. They carried alſo a great number of divers of your Petitioners Bookes,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:113796:48"/>and other things from one Mr <hi>Archers</hi> houſe as he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. Further, your Petitioner being denyed the Copy of his Commitment by the Gaoler of Newgate, his wife with ſome friends, repaired to the Sheriffe, offering him Bayle, according to the Statute in that behalf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Attorney at Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sheriffe replyed, <hi>That he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Lawes of the Land, and Priviledges of the Subject had never been named in the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. Your Petitioner (having thus ſuffered in Body, Liberty, Family, Eſtate, and Name) at the end of fifteen weeks was ſerved with a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paena,</hi> and an Information laid againſt him by Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> then his Majeſties Attorney-Generall, whoſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with your Petitioner was full of cruelty, and deceit. In the mean time it did more then appear to four Phyſitians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that poyſon had been given him in New-gate; for his hair and skin came off in a ſickneſſe (deadly to the Eye) in the height whereof, as he did lye, Cenſure was paſt againſt him in the Star-Chamber, without hearing (which hath not bin heard of) notwithſtanding of a Certificate from four Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, and Aſt davit made by an Attorney of the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe of the Diſeaſe. But nothing would ſerve D. <hi>Lawd,</hi> but the higheſt Cenſure that ever was paſt in that Court to be put upon him; and ſo it was to be inflicted with Knife, Fire, and Whip, at, and upon the Pillory, with ter thouſand pound Tine; which ſome of the Lords conceived (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt himſelf to a man of note) ſhould never be inflicted: Onely it was impoſed (as on a dying man) to terrifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But the ſaid Doctor and his Combinants cauſed the ſaid Cenſure to be executed the 26. day of <hi>November,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (with a Witneſſe) for the Hang-man was armed with ſtrong drink all the night before in Priſon, and with threatning words to do it cruelly. Your Petitioners hands being tyed to a ſtake (beſides all other torments) he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thirty ſix ſtripes with a terrible Cord. After which, he ſtood almoſt two houres on the Pillory, in cold Froſt and Snow and ſuffered the reſt; as cutting off the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And being ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his Sufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was not able to goe, the Warden of the Fleet would not ſuffer him to be carried in a Coach; but he was forced to go by water, to the further indangering of his life. Returning to the Gaole, after much harſh and cruell uſage for the ſpace of eight years, paying more for a chamber than thrice the worth of it (having not a bit of bread, nor drop of water al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Clerk of the Fleet to top up your Petitioners ſufferings, ſent for him to his Office and without Warrant, or cauſe given by your Petitioner, ſet eight ſtrong Fellowes upon him, who tore his cloaths, buiſed his body; ſo that ſince, he was never well, and carryed him by head and heeles to that loathſome common Gaole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where beſides the filthineſſe of the place, and vildneſſe of the company, divers contrivements were laid for taking away your Petitioners life, as ſhall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if your Honours will be pleaſed to receive and peruſe a Schedule of that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Now the cauſe of all this harſh cruell, and continued ill uſage (unparallel'd yet upon any one, ſince Brittain was Chriſtian) was nothing but a Book written by your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, called <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
